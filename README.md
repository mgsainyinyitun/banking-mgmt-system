## Banking Management System

First, run the development server:

#
Banking Management System built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, featuring distinct modules for both admin and customer users. The admin section includes a robust dashboard that provides real-time insights through components like UserCountCards, UserGrowth, and MoneyFlow visualizations powered by Recharts. Administrators can manage user accounts, view detailed user profiles, handle transactions, and configure settings through intuitive interfaces. The customer side offers functionalities such as viewing account balances, recent transactions, managing profiles, and handling invoices, all wrapped in a responsive and user-friendly design using NextUI components. The project leverages Prisma for database interactions, ensuring efficient data management and scalability. Additionally, features like authentication, theming, and real-time updates enhance the overall user experience, making the system both secure and highly interactive.
